* TODO show the bloody turtle
* TODO on-page js console
  http://jsconsole.com/ ?
* TODO code/demo sharing 

** show source code on page
** have editor/runner there too.

* Goals

Why the fuck am I doing this? I just want a very minimal environment that uses actual HTML rather than some language I make up, because that is just more useful.

That is, this should teach (some version of) actual web programming, not be a sandbox.

Alternatives: use a better language that compiles or is interpreted by JS (ClojureScript, or a (to-be-invented) LogoScript.
